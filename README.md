# Flutter BLoC State Management Practice
This repository contains my practice projects using BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management in Flutter. It includes a variety of examples demonstrating different functionalities, such as a counter, calculator, todo list, and fetching data from an API. Each example showcases how to handle state management in a clean, efficient, and scalable way using the BLoC pattern.

# Projects
# 1. Counter App
A simple counter app that demonstrates the basic implementation of BLoC to manage increment and decrement operations.

Features: Increment, decrement counter value
BLoC Usage: Manages counter state using a BLoC with events for increment and decrement actions.
# 2. Calculator App
A basic calculator that uses BLoC to handle arithmetic operations.

Features: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
BLoC Usage: Manages calculation logic and state to keep the UI updated with real-time results.
# 3. Todo List
A todo list app that allows users to add and remove tasks, demonstrating how to manage a list of items using BLoC.

Features: Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete
BLoC Usage: Uses a BLoC to manage the list of tasks, with events for adding, deleting, and toggling task completion.
# 4. API Fetch Example
An example app that fetches data from an API and displays it in a list.

Features: Fetch data, display list of items, refresh data
BLoC Usage: Manages API calls and data state, handling loading, success, and error states in the UI.
